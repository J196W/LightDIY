# LightDIY

An open source MIDI programming wing for PC lightboards. 

## Goals

- Create an HID (Human Interface Device) out of stock components, such as Cherry MX Keys and Slider Potentiometers
- Use a microcontroler to interpret the HID, and send that as a MIDI signal over both MIDI jack and MIDI over USB
- Implement integration into ETC Nomad, MAonPC for use with at home lighting soluions
- Keep it open source!

## About this project

This project was created by (literaly) two broke college roomates, neither of which are computer science majors. It came out of the need of one roomate, who is a Theatre Lighting Major, to allow for in-room control without buying thousands of dollars worth of equipment.

The code with be sloppy. The diagrams will be rough. But in the end, we hope for a product that is both functional, and unapologetically DIY.

All prototyping was done at 1819 Innovation Hub at the University of Cincinnati. Check it out! It is a really cool place!

## Current Progress

- [ ] Prototype with Slide Potentiometers and Interactions w/ MIDI
- [ ] Integrate large scale interactions w/ Multiplexers
- [ ] Rework for use with smaller scale electronics (Sparkfun Pro MIDI)
- [ ] Design external enclosure/slide nobs
- [ ] Assemble v0.1 on Protoboard and fit into enclosure
- [ ] Release v0.1
